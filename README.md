# Becom ToF Camera API

This is a copy of Becom System's BltTofApi library communicating with their series of cameras. The original code
can be found at the [Becom Software Support Wiki](https://support.bluetechnix.at/wiki/Blt_ToF_API)

It has been adapted to be compilable with cmake and support for OSX (Ventura, at the time of writing) for 
simpler porting to other platforms.
